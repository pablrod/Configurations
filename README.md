### Workstations automated configuration

This is my personal setup for automated configuration of my computers.

I want to keep in sync my computer at work, home, etc

I use [Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/) and the installation and configuration is automated with:

* kickstart: bootstrap the install
* [Rex](http://www.rexify.org/): config install (as a kickstart postinstall step) and keep the config in sync
